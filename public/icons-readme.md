# PWA Icons

The following icons are required for the PWA to function properly:

## Required Icons

- **icon-192x192.png** - Main app icon (192x192px)
- **icon-512x512.png** - Large app icon (512x512px)
- **badge-72x72.png** - Badge icon for notifications (72x72px)

## How to Generate

You can use tools like:
- [PWA Asset Generator](https://www.pwabuilder.com/imageGenerator)
- [Favicon.io](https://favicon.io/)
- Any image editor (Photoshop, Figma, Canva)

## Design Guidelines

- Use a simple, recognizable design
- Ensure good contrast for visibility
- Test on both light and dark backgrounds
- Follow the safe zone guidelines (avoid important content in outer 10%)

## Temporary Solution

For development, you can create simple placeholder icons with a solid color background and initials "WG".
